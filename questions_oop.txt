What is a pointer in C++?
option: A type of variable that can store multiple values
option: A function that returns a value

What is the difference between a pointer and a reference in C++?
option: Pointers cannot be used to call member functions, while references can
option: References cannot be reassigned to refer to a different object, while pointers can
option dabfac4: Pointers store the memory address of a variable, while references refer directly to a variable
option: References can only be used with built-in data types, while pointers can be used with any data type
